## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Seven App
- **Category**: identity

### Description
Seven App provides decentralized, privacy-preserving identity.
It solves the issue of relying only on wallet addresses or centralized logins by enabling verifiable identities across dApps using zero-knowledge proofs.

### SL Integration  
- Use SL to generate and verify ZK-proofs of identity.
- Store attestations on SL for cross-dApp usage.
- Integrate SL contracts for login/verification.

## Technical

### Architecture
Frontend (React) → Backend (Node.js) → SL Contracts → IPFS/WALRUS storage.
User logs in → generates ZK proof → proof verified on SL → access granted.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js  
- **Blockchain**: SL + EVM testnet
- **Storage**: WALRUS/IPFS

### Features
1. Decentralized identity wallet
2. ZK-based login/verification
